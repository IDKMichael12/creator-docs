This UdonBehaviour example script allows you easily to override your world's avatar scaling settings.

To learn how to write your own Udon script for avatar scaling, read our [avatar scaling documentation](/worlds/udon/players/player-avatar-scaling).

## Variables

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| - | - | - | - |
| **disableAvatarScaling** | bool | false | | If enabled, players in your world will not be able to choose their own avatar scale, even if you enabled it on VRChat.com. |
| **minimumHeight** | float | 0.2 | The minimum avatar eye height in meters which players can choose. |
| **maximumHeight** | float | 5 | The maximum avatar eye height in meters which players can choose. |
| **alwaysEnforceHeight** | bool | true| If enabled, players who switch to use a very tall or very short avatar will automatically be set to "minimumHeight" or "maximumHeight". 

## Examples

- I want players to use avatar scaling freely.
	- You don't need to change any settings.
- I don't want players to use avatar scaling.
	- Turn on "disableAvatarScaling."
- I want players to use a specific avatar height.
	- Set "minimumHeight" and "maximumHeight" how you prefer.
	- If you want to prevent very tall or very short avatars, enable "alwaysEnforceHeight".

Here's what the Udon Graph for the example script looks like:
